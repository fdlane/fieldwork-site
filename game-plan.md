## Game Plan
To achieve functional software it is necessary to have smooth communication among team members. We used the messaging system Slack as it also allows the exchange of files and can be organized into channels.

To achieve reliable software it is necessary to have source code management with strict rules. We used GitHub developers push their programs to a non-main branch then issue a pull request for others to review their code. Our rules were set such that at least two other team members had to approve the code before it is squashed and merged to the main branch. Then the non-main branch where the code was initially placed is deleted. This prevents any version confusion.

Team members were divided by tasks. For example one worked on the login task since the login for dispatcher would be the same as the login for the dispatcher. Another team member worked on the appearance of the web pages.
