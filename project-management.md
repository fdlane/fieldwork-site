## Project Management
### Team Structure
Team members were divided by tasks. Two team members focused on the functionality  of the software, another on the user interface, and finally one to document the work.

### Communication
* Trello allows all team members to see what tasks need to be done and who is doing them.<br />

* Slack achieves clear communication by allowing channels for specific topics.<br />

### Version Control
* Git is software that can be utilized to allow each individual to work on files on their own side branch while the master branch contains the files that are actually deployed. Differences in the side branch with files on the master branch have to be resolved before a file on a side branch can be merged with the master branch.<br />

* GitHub hosts git software. For this project rules were put into place that prevented anyone from directly placing files on the master branch. Files on the side branch had to be reviewed by a different person and approved before merging that file. Once the merge is complete the sidebranch can be deleted; deleted branches can be recovered if necessary.<br />
