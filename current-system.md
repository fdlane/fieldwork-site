## KUB
### Currently
Currently KUB has a system for a dispatcher to receive jobs that need to be done, dispatcher has a list of field technicians & can assign a technician to a job & can find out its status. Sometimes a job is cancelled so in that case the dispatcher wants to be able to communicate this right away. The field technician has a mobile device that receives the dispatchers directives and can keep the dispatcher up to date on their progress.
### Plans
Right now KUB is in the process of switching out meters and they want before and after photos of this to ensure correct meter reading at the time of the switch. The problem is the slowness of the system and the bulkiness of the storage. KUB wants to store data in the cloud to improve the speed of communication – they want all devices updated quickly. They do not want the users to have to keep asking about progress or tasks – if something changes then all devices are simultaneously and quickly updated to reflect the new situation.
