## Project Charter
This cloud-based Fieldwork System is a proof of concept for KUB to develop mobile and dispatch applications. These will be implemented in Ember JS using Firebase hosting for data, photos, static web pages, database, and security. We are using GitHub for source control, Heroku for hosting as well as NodeJS applications.


### Plans
KUB is in the process of switching out all of their electric meters. They want to include before and after photos of this to ensure correct meter reading at the time of the switch. The problem is the slowness of the system and the bulkiness of the storage. KUB wants to store data in the cloud to improve the speed of communication and to have all devices update whenever information in the database changes.
